## Prerequisites

- Dependencies:
    - `node.js` >= 8
    - Commands used under the hood that your operating system needs to support:
        - `sshfs`
        - `fusermount`
        - `mount`
        - `ps`
        - `kill`
    - `npm` to install

- Supported operating systems
    - Ubuntu &ndash; tested, works
    - MacOs &ndash; tested on older versions of sshfs-box, should work

## Install

- `npm install --global sshfs-box`

## Usage

- `sshfs-box`
    - Starts the interface for mounting/unmounting.
    - When running for the first time, it will prompt to create a new config.
- `sshfs-box --config` or `sshfs-box -c`
    - Configure remote & local paths to connect.
- `sshfs-box --help`
    - Displays available CLI commands.

### Configuration

- Configuration is displayed when sshfs-box app is run for the first time or when passing the `--config` flag.
- Config is stored in `~/.config/sshfs-box.json`.

#### Config example

```json
{
    urls: [
        "username@host1:",
        "username@host2:/home/user",
        "username@host2:/www"
    ],
    "folder": "/home/username/remote"
},
```

### Config fields

- `urls`
    - `Required` field.
    - `Array` of strings of remote locations that sshfs-box will connect to with SSHFS.
- `folder`
    - `Required` field.
    - `String` of the local folder where remote locations will be mounted.
    - If the folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.
- With the given example config `username@host:/dir/subdir` will be avaliable in `/home/username/remote/username@host:-dir-subdir`.

## Potential improvements

- Mounting/Unmounting of multiple locations is currently done synchronously, maybe we could parallelize if performance is a problem.
- Add support for separator in config urls https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#separator.
